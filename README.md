# ShootEmUp
This is an educational project made during the course "Unreal Engine C++ Development" by Yuri Popov on Udemy. It has two levels on of which is a test map and a deathmatch map.
Project was made principally with C++ and a little bit of Blueprints where using C++ was just redundant. Assets are from Epic Games project called "Shooter Game", but all of the work with them performed by me.
